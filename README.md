# sublime-bem-indent-syntax

> Sublime plugin to expand [bem-indent-syntax](https://github.com/tadatuta/bem-indent-syntax) abbreviation into [BEMJSON](https://en.bem.info/technology/bemjson/).

## Install

Install `bem-indent-syntax` with [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net) and restart Sublime.

**You need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 6.x installed.**
Make sure it's in your `$PATH` by running `node -v` in your command-line.
On OS X you need to make sure it's in `/usr/local/bin` or symlink it there (e.g. if you've installed node with `nvm`).

## Getting started

In a BEMJSON file, open the Command Palette *(Cmd+Shift+P)* and choose `Expand bem-indent-syntax abbreviation`. You can alternatively create one or more selections before running the command to only expand those parts.

### Keyboard shortcut

You can set up a keyboard shortcut to run the command by opening up "Preferences > Key Bindings - User" and adding your shortcut with the `bem-indent-syntax` command.

Example:

```json
[
	{ "keys": ["super+b"], "command": "bem-indent-syntax" }
]
```
